# Uber-Ride-Price-prediction-using-RandomForest-and-Linear-Regression

This project predicts **Uber ride prices** from pickup to drop-off location.  
It compares two machine learning models — **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**
## Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values)
- Outlier detection (IQR method)
- Feature engineering (trip distance, time features)
- Correlation analysis
- Model training:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Model evaluation with **R², RMSE, MAE**

---

##  Metrics
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)** → closer to 1 is better  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** → average prediction error  
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** → average absolute difference
